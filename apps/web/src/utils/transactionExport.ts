/**
 * The four transaction reports: wholesale buy and sell, retail buy and sell.
 *
 * One builder serves all of them. The domains differ in vocabulary and in which weight is the real
 * one — a wholesale buy reports what was *delivered* against what was ordered, a wholesale sell what
 * was *agreed* against what the buyer contests, and retail has one weight and nothing to compare it
 * against — but the shape of the report is identical, so the differences are a config object rather
 * than four near-copies that drift.
 *
 * **That sameness is the deliverable, not a convenience.** The question these files exist to answer
 * is whether the shop bought well and sold well, and that is only readable if all four state their
 * average the same way: value in THB over volume in gold baht, over the same kind of window, with
 * the same rows excluded. A retail average computed even slightly differently could not be held
 * against a wholesale one.
 *
 * Each page maps its own transactions into `TransactionExportRow` before calling in. That mapping is
 * where `countsTowardTotal()` and the page's own `amountOf` are applied, so the file totals exactly
 * what the screen totals.

 * figure as hard as a 50-baht one, answering a question nobody asked. What the manager wants is
 * what the window's gold actually cost, or fetched, per baht.
 *
 * The denominator is **gold baht on both sheets**, including the kilogram one, and this is what
 * makes the report read correctly across purities. The business prices gold per gold baht, and one
 * gold baht of 99.9% is worth more than one gold baht of 96.5%. The kg→GB conversion is pure mass
 * (1 GB ≈ 15.244 g at any purity, `conversionFactor`), so the purity difference lives in the
 * *price*: `pricePerGb999 = pricePerGb965 × 99.9/96.5`. Dividing value by mass-GB therefore hands
 * back each sheet's own quote, and the 99.9% sheet reads higher than the 96.5% one — as it should.
 * Dividing the kilogram sheet by its kilogram total would instead print a THB/kg figure under a
 * THB/บาททอง heading and destroy the comparison.
